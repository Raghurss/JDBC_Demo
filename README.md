Data plays a significant role everywhere. Also, there is as much importance to the Connectivity of data. JDBC stands for Java DataBase Connectivity.
To get connected with the database and access the data from the IDE is one such thing worthy to be known.
Starting with this.. Getting connected with Database from netbeans or any Java IDE can be divided into 7 basic steps.
 
 (1).Importing the Package
 
 (2)(a).Loading the Driver
    
 (2)(b).Registering the Driver
 
 (3).Establishing the Connection
  
 (4).Creating the Statement
  
 (5).Executing the Query
  
 (6).Processing the Result
 
 (7).Closing the Statement and Connection

This 7 step protocol like stuff is implemented through Java on NetBeans in this JDBC_Demo File.
